This is the group assignment which titled Library Management System in C++, I combine everyone code into the app.cpp so that the C++ program can run successfully. I do 

5.	Write a function bool Display(List*list, int source, int detail) to display the list list. 
The variable source is used to determine where to print the output and the variable detail is used to determine what to print as shown below:
source = 1 (display to file)
source = 2 (display to screen)
detail = 1 (display student info and book info)
